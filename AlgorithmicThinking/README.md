# Algorithmic Thinking - A Problem-Based Introduction

Solutions to different problems from Daniel Zingaro [book](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Thinking-Problem-Based-Daniel-Zingaro/dp/1718500807)

## My Approach

1. Learn the Algorithm.
2. Look at the code and read the explaination.
3. Form a deep understanding of the provided solution. How does it work? Why did we do this?
4. Code your own solution with your understanding. Redo step 2 and 3 to reinforce the idea.
5. In your own word, explain the solution to the code you've written.
